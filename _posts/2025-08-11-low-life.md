High-high, get-get, gettin' high, everybody gettin' high

Get-get-get-gettin' high, you're unbelievably high

I just took some molly, what else? (Hey)

Got some bitch from Follies with us ('scuse me, 'scuse me)

She gon' fuck the squad, what else? (I swear)

I'ma fuck her broads, what else? (Yeah, yeah)

Bitch from Pakistan, what up? ('Rari)

Ferraris and 'em Lambs, what else? (Skrrt, 'krrt)

'Bout to fuck this club up, what else? (Yeah, yeah)

(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga, turn up)

I turn the Ritz into a poor house (turn up)

It's like eviction number four now (woo)

Go 'head and ash it on the floor now (swear)

Girl, go 'head and show me how you go down

And I feel my whole body peakin' (yeah)

And I'm fuckin' anybody with they legs wide (racks)

Gettin' faded with some bitches from the West Side (woo)

East coast nigga reppin' North Side, never waste a ho's time (Freebandz)

Bitch, I'm on my own time, fuck a nigga co-sign (woo)

Always change my number and my phone line (and my, and my)

Baby girl, I don't lie, used to have no money for a crib (turn up)

Now my room service bill cost your whole life (ayy)

If they try to stunt me, I go all out military (turn up)

I'm camo'd all out, like I'm in the military (turn up)

And free up all my niggas locked up in the penitenti' (swear)

'Cause I'm always reppin' for that low life

Reppin' for that low life (turn up), low life, low life

Low life, know I'm reppin' for that low

Low life (representin'), yeah (I'm representin')

Said I'm reppin' for that low life (representin')

Low life, low life, low life, low life (I'm representin' for that low life)

Said I'm reppin' for that low life (I'm reppin', that's reppin', I'm reppin')

Low life, low life, low life (rep, rep, rep, rep, rep, rep, rep, woo, woo), yeah

Wake up, take a sip of Ace of Spade like it's water

I been on the molly and 'em Xans with your daughter

If she catch me cheatin', I won't ever tell her, "Sorry"

If she catch me cheatin', I will never tell her, "Sorry"

Porsches in the valet, I got Bentleys, I got 'Raris

Takin' pain pills on the plane, gettin' chartered

Poppin' tags on tags, I was starvin', bitch, I got the juice and the carbine

Turn a five-star hotel to a trap house

Roaches everywhere, like we forgot to take the trash out

Flood my cross with ice, gettin' money my religion

Got my baby mama and my side bitch kissin'

I turn the Ritz into a lean house (yeah), this the sixth time gettin' kicked out (woo)

I can't feel my face, I'm on Adderall, nauseous

Niggas tryna ride my fuckin' wave, now they salty

Runnin' with the wave, get you killed quick

Shoot you in your back like you Ricky (Ricky)

Lil' Mexico, with no life to afterlife, my whole life, my whole life

'Cause I'm always reppin' for that low life (wait), low life, low life

Low life, know I'm reppin' for that low

Low life (representin'), yeah (I'm representin')

Said I'm reppin' for that low life (representin', wait)

Low life, low life, low life, low life (I'm representin' for that low life, for the low life)

Said I'm reppin' for that low life (for the low life, I'm reppin' for the low life)

Low life, low life, low life (wait, wait, low life), yeah

Yeah, they stereotypin' 'cause they know a nigga keep ten rifles (ten rifles)

And they know a nigga keep ten snipers (ten snipers)

Keepin' baby bottles like we wearin' diapers

Yeah, they stereotypin' 'cause they know a nigga keep 20 rifles

And they know a nigga keep 20 snipers

And they know a nigga keep ten wifeys (ha-ha-ha)

Sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper

Wifey, wifey, wifey, wifey, wifey

That's your wifey, wifey, wifey, wifey?

I think I like her, like her, like her, like her

That's your wifey, wifey, wifey, wifey?

I think I like her, like her, like her, like her

Oh, that's your wifey, wifey, wifey, wifey?

I think I like her, like her, like her, like her, ha

Gettin' high, gettin', gettin' high, everybody gettin' high

Gettin', gettin', gettin' high, everybody gettin' high

High-high, gettin', gettin' high, everybody gettin' high

Gettin', gettin', gettin' high, and I'm the reason why

I just took some molly, what else?

(Gettin', gettin', gettin' high, everybody gettin' high) got some bitch from Follies with us

(High-high, gettin', gettin' high, everybody gettin' high) she gon' fuck the squad, what else?
