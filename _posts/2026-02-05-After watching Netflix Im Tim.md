I will not argue about how they presented the documentary. It is evident that it is not perfect, but that is inconsequential.

As an MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) patient, seeing Avicii so joyful and adored by many brought me to tears. His radiant smile and enjoyment of the moment were heartwarming, yet it stirred a mix of happiness and sorrow within me. I felt deeply conflicted by my emotions.

I noticed he was always anxious, and only drinking seemed to relieve his unease. It reminded me of myself, as the need to drink gradually increased to find satisfaction.

As a renowned DJ, he traveled extensively worldwide for tours, requiring him to consume more to manage the numerous performances. Additionally, he continued creating music even while on the move.

I once succeeded in my business, but whenever I encountered struggles, I coped by drinking excessive whiskey. Eventually, I reached a point where I couldn't manage anything, leading me to quit my job and confine myself to bed. This made me realize that sometimes, people like me must accept our own fragility. Even someone like Avicii, who seemed stronger, was ultimately still vulnerable.

Seeing Avicii's father cry brought tears to my eyes. I can only imagine their longing to have their beloved Tim back, no matter the cost. However, time cannot be reversed, and we must move forward. Avicii will forever hold a special place in my heart as a legend.
